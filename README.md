# 🛰️ Atlas Web Backend

Early-stage backend projects built during my time at Atlas School, focused on developing core backend skills with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
This project represents the foundation of future full-stack applications and explores initial concepts like routing, controllers, authentication, and database connectivity.



## ✨ Features

-🚀 Basic Express.js server setup
-🔒 User authentication and session management
-🗃️ MongoDB database connection
-🔄 RESTful API structure with scalable routing
-🛠️ Modular controller and service layers



## 🛠 Tech Stack

-Node.js + Express for backend server
-MongoDB for data persistence
-Mongoose for ODM (Object Data Modeling)
-Redis for session and cache handling
-Docker (optional future integration)



## 📚 Project Goals

-Build a modular, scalable backend starting from scratch
-Practice setting up secure authentication flows
-Connect and interact with a MongoDB database
-Develop a clean folder structure for future expansion



## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/atlas-web_back_end.git
cd <project name>



## 🧠 Challenges Faced

-Setting up a clean folder structure for a growing API
-Managing asynchronous MongoDB operations
-Planning authentication flow early without frontend access yet
